So this was mostly bringing all my elements in together. I brought everything into one project as multiple levels and implemented my method of switching levels (finding an object on the beach and clicking it). 
[ ***____*** < means it's something specific I'd like feedback/help on if this is TLDR ]

Level Switching: For this I still need to figure out a way to destroy the canoe in a way that it's gone when you return to the level. I'm sure there's some way of saving the state of the level so I can destroy the canoe and it stays destroyed when you return, but as of yet I haven't figured it out (as I'm typing this I'm realizing that this is the exact phrasing I should have been using for my googling, so I'll check that out).
For switching back from the River level to the Beach, I wasn't sure how I wanted it done. My initial idea was to have the player take a set amount of pictures, which then returns them, but I didn't like this idea because what if they didn't realize? So I changed it instead to once they reach a certain point, after a delay they return. This "certain point" leads me to my next subject...

Canoe Path: This was a doozy. I'd already figured out how to get buoyancy working so the canoe will float with the waves (but I figured out how pontoons work and made it 10x better), but for some reason I couldn't get the canoe to move down the river. I'm not sure if maybe this isn't actually possible and I'm misunderstanding (although I could have sworn I saw a tutorial on it at the beginning of the semester), but I couldn't get it to work so I pivoted to making the boat follow a spline path. The boat now flows down the river on this path and takes a curve in the lake. Unfortunately, this meant that the boat couldn't have natural buoyancy (as I couldn't figure out ***how to disconnect only the vertical axis from the rest of the transform/location in the blueprint***), so I may add in some character head bob to try and simulate the buoyancy, although I'm worried it'll look weird if you look at the boat.

Character Control (River): This level has the character sitting in a boat and going down a river. As such, they shouldn't be able to move so I stole their legs and shrunk them down to make it look like sitting, so that now the player can't drown themselves by walking off, and can only look around and take pictures. However, having them "sitting" brings up the other problem of now ***they can look down and see they have no legs, so I'm stuck between if I should give the player a body in the canoe or just clamp their vision so that they can't look down*** (I'm leaning towards the second)

River Level: This is... a complete rework of what I submitted in my create assignment. I don't know why, I just wasn't feeling the giant lake vibes anymore, so I converted it into a river (also because I wanted to have the boat flow down which didn't work :(. ) ***I'm worried that the trees look a little repetitve***, so I'm going to show it to a couple people and ask for feedback. I didn't want to add in too many trees because they make the project very big and very slow, so I put the giant cliffs behind the trees to give it that depth without a million different objects. I also added in animals resting and grazing (deer and crows) because I thought they were cute and added something more to the scene than just trees and cliffs. Following this idea, I'm considering adding a firepit and maybe chairs where the other canoe is pulled on shore, again to give something more to look at. I'm quite happy with this level how it is now, and I'm glad it turned out the way I wanted (it's loosely based off pictures and videos I took on a recent trip to Alberta, with the mountains and the clear beautiful blue water).

What's left: I want to make another level to have some more to the game. I'm thinking of making the snow level, because I think the idea of throwing snowballs is fun and a simple enough mechanic, and that making the toboggan go fast down a hill would be pretty cool too. For this one I'm worried that all the white snow will make it very bright and hard to look at, so that's going to be a concern I have to play around with and figure out (as I don't want to just have every level be sunset). 
I also have to add sound. I hate sound. This is going to be painful. But it'll add so much to the levels that I'll do it. 
Just a general note of I'm going to change how the text looks. I'm not a fan of the Roboto font but there are so many fonts online that it's hard to pick just one to use.
