					<h2 style="font-size: 2em"> "The Last of Us Part II Remix" </h2>
					<p> After noticing how the message of the song “Bad Guy” by Billie Eilish reflected the themes
					in the story line of “The Last of Us II” I created this transformative fan video to juxtapose
					two media pieces that I really enjoyed while practicing my audio and video editing skills. </p>
					<p> The protagonists, Abby and Ellie, are two sides to the same coin. This is shown in the
					selection and editing of the clips to match shots so the action flows between the two of
					them. Furthermore, the heavy beat of the music matches the fast paced action of game,
					and allowed for crisp transitions and cuts. The video also includes various sound effects
					from the game itself, such as guns being shot or the "infected" screaming, as a way to keep
					the video and audio tied together and add more immersion to the video. </p>
					<p> The song title "Bad Guy" reflects their stories. Each ends up being the bad guy of the other's
					story, killing each others loved ones for revenge. I also drew a parallel with how the song
					was received in our society. Billie Eilish faced a lot of misogyny as a young, successful
					woman as her popularity increased. The same misogyny was received by the game upon
					its release, as many male fans of the original game were against the two protagonists of the
					game being strong women, claiming that it was forcing “the feminist agenda” by having
					a gay protagonist and a strongl woman as a protagonist. By editing both works together,
					I was able to highlight their common messages and create a new level of engagement for
					both works. </p>
